# Untangling the Osquery❓ tables web🕸 using Jupyter Notebooks📓 Repository
This repository is used to hold Jupyter Notebooks that are used to work with Osquery tables and data.  
This repository is also used to support https://sevickson.github.io/ with data for sharing in blogs.  

[OSQuery-Tables-interactive_Jupyterthon](OSQuery-Tables-interactive_Jupyterthon.ipynb) is a Jupyter Notebook I created for a talk I gave at [Infosec Jupyterthon!](https://infosecjupyterthon.com/introduction.html)

At this moment I have the following to-dos for the `OSQuery-Tables-interactive` Notebook:
- [ ] Create graphs for Linux, macOS and FreeBSD.
- [ ] Check the data returned from the tables when querying and use that data to further fine-tune the filtering.
- [ ] Not all shortest paths are correct, data in the columns do not match, maybe use the same data as previous bullet to build correct paths.
